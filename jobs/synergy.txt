########## key differences between Django and Flask frameworks

Flask :
Description: Flask is a lightweight, micro web framework ideal for creating web servers. It provides flexibility, allowing developers to choose and integrate only the components needed for a specific project.
Example: If you want to build a small to medium-sized application and have control over the components you use, Flask is a great choice.

Django :
Description: Django is used for creating full-stack web applications. It's a high-level, full-stack web framework that follows conventions, meaning it has a set of rules.
Example: When building a comprehensive web application that requires a structured approach and built-in features, Django is a solid choice.

##########  handle database operations in Django and Flask

Django:

Database Handling :
Django has a built-in database file called SQLite, making it easy for developers to start without additional configurations.
Models in Django classes automatically translate into database tables, simplifying CRUD operations.
To use MySQL instead of SQLite, we have to install mysqlclient and  modifications in the settings file are needed, providing database credentials.

Flask:

Database Handling:
Flask doesn't have built-in database operations, giving developers the flexibility to choose databases.
Developers can also use SQLAlchemy, or Database operations can be performed using traditional methods, like manually writing SQL queries.

##########   ORM, and how does it benefit in database operations
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):

Definition: ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It's a technique that allows developers to interact with databases using Python objects instead of raw SQL queries.
Benefit: ORM simplifies database operations by translating Python code into database queries.This leads to cleaner and more maintainable code.

##########  Difference between filter and get in django
filter:

Usage: filter is used to retrieve a queryset containing multiple objects that match the specified filter criteria.
Example: If you use filter to find users with a specific email, it might return multiple users (if there are multiple users with the same email).
python
Copy code
users = UserRegister.objects.filter(Email=email)
get:

Usage: get is used when you expect only one result from the query, and it retrieves a single object that matches the specified filter criteria.
Example: If you use get to find a user with a specific email, it assumes there is only one user with that email, and it returns that single user.
python
Copy code
user = UserRegister.objects.get(Email=email)
Key Differences:

filter returns a queryset (which can contain multiple objects), while get returns a single object.
If filter doesn't find any matching objects, it returns an empty queryset. If get doesn't find any matching object or finds more than one, it raises an exception (DoesNotExist or MultipleObjectsReturned).
Use filter when you expect multiple results or when the result might be empty. Use get when you expect a single result, and an exception should be raised if there are zero or multiple results.

-> Cron Job
A cron job is a scheduled task that runs automatically at specified time intervals without manual intervention. To implement this in Python, you can use a library like APScheduler to create a scheduler within your script. Define the task as a function or code block, add it to the scheduler, and specify when it should run using a cron-like syntax. Finally, start the scheduler to initiate the automatic execution of the scheduled task.

if one of my collegue commit a changes that i don't want so how can i revert back

-> revert in a version-controlled system (such as Git)

git branch
git checkout <branch_name>
git revert <commit_hash>
git diff
git commit -m "Revert changes from <commit_hash>"
git push origin <branch_name>

->  built function we use to for empty input feild in foem front end validation

In HTML forms, you can use the required attribute to enforce that a field must be filled out before submitting the form. 

-> To find the employee with the highest salary in a SQL database
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1;

-> SELECT rollno.rollno, rollno.name, exam.exam_id, exam.score
FROM rollno
LEFT JOIN exam ON rollno.rollno = exam.rollno;

->  A foreign key in a table is a column that represents the primary key of another table. It establishes a connection between two tables, where the table containing the foreign key is referred to as the child table. The values in the foreign key column must align with the values in the primary key of the referenced table. This ensures a relationship between the two tables, and the foreign key serves as a link between them, allowing for data integrity and relational connections.

CREATE TABLE exam (
    rollno INT,
    s_code INT PRIMARY KEY,
    marks INT,
    p_code INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (rollno) REFERENCES student(rollno)
);
