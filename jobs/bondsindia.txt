post and put method difference
-> we can not use put to insert the data
-> we can update by post

update query with join table
-> UPDATE employees JOIN departments 
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id
SET employees.salary = employees.salary * 1.1
WHERE departments.department_name = 'Engineering';
