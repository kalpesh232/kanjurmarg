post and put method difference
-> we can not use put to insert the data
-> we can update by post

update query with join table
-> UPDATE employees JOIN departments 
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id
SET employees.salary = employees.salary * 1.1
WHERE departments.department_name = 'Engineering';


json.dump
list slicing

-> The SQL HAVING Clause
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
