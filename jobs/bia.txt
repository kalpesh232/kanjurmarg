->  AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) in JavaScript 
In simple terms, we use AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) in JavaScript to make web pages more dynamic and responsive. Instead of reloading the entire web page when you need new data, AJAX allows you to send and receive small amounts of data with the server in the background. This helps in updating specific parts of a webpage without requiring a full page refresh, creating a smoother and faster user experience.

-> Synchronous in JavaScript
Synchronous in JavaScript means doing one thing at a time, step by step. It's like following a recipe where you do one instruction before moving on to the next. This can make your program wait for things to finish.
For example, if you have a pop-up message (like an alert), the program stops until you deal with the message.
In contrast, asynchronous is like multitasking. It lets your program do things at the same time, so you don't have to wait for each task to finish before starting the next one.

-> invoked In JavaScript
In JavaScript, 'invoked' means calling or running a function. When you invoke a function, you're telling the computer to execute the set of instructions inside that function. It's like pressing a play button for a specific action in your code.

-> contentType
contentType: 'application/json;charset=UTF-8': Specifies the type of content being sent in the request, indicating that it's JSON.
